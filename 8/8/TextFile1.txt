Hello World! I am a new user of this forum and I am looking for some help. I am a student and I am working on a project that involves the use of a 3D printer. I am looking for a 3D printer that can print in a variety of materials, including metal. I have been doing some research and I have found that there are a few different types of 3D printers that can print in metal, but I am not sure which one would be the best for my project. I would appreciate any advice or recommendations that you could give me. Thank you!
